# qt-llm

`qt-llm` is a lightweight Qt-based LLM interface layer for desktop applications. It provides a practical Qt/C++ foundation for building products with built-in support for LLM conversation, Tools, MCP, SKILL, and Agent workflows.

The project is designed for direct code-level integration into a user's own Qt application. It keeps the reusable core, practical tool apps, and business-agent references clearly separated so developers can adopt only the layers they need.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide:

- a lightweight Qt-oriented LLM interface layer
- built-in support for LLM conversation, Tools, MCP, SKILL, and Agent development
- direct C++/Qt integration into a user's own project
- runtime monitoring, tracing, and analysis for LLM workflows

This repository is not positioned as a web-first orchestration service. It is positioned as a Qt/C++ integration base that can be embedded into desktop products and internal tools with a low adoption barrier.

## Three Layers

The repository follows a three-part top-level structure.

### 1. `qtllm` (`src/qtllm/`)

This is the core layer.

It provides reusable infrastructure for:

- provider abstraction
- request/response execution
- streaming response handling
- conversation management
- tool runtime
- MCP integration
- storage
- logging and tracing
- runtime observability support

### 2. `apps` (`src/apps/`)

This is the practical tools layer.

It contains host and utility applications built on top of the core layer, including examples such as chat hosts, MCP tools, and `toolsinside`-style analysis utilities.

These apps are useful in their own right, but they also serve as reference hosts for how to build on `qtllm`.

### 3. `agents` (`src/agents/`)

This is the business-agent layer.

It is used to build common Agents and to provide reference implementations for Agent development. These applications validate how to build workflow-oriented products on top of the shared core instead of adding business logic into `src/apps/`.

The current reference agent is:

- `src/agents/pdf_translator_agent/`

## Integration Style

The intended usage style is simple:

- include and link the `qtllm` library in a Qt project
- configure providers and runtime capabilities in C++
- compose conversation, tool, MCP, SKILL, and Agent flows inside the user's own UI and application logic

The design goal is to make code-level integration concise and practical for Qt developers.

## Monitoring, Tracing, and Analysis

A major feature of the project is that it does not stop at request execution.

It also emphasizes runtime monitoring, tracing, and analysis for:

- LLM conversation flows
- tool execution flows
- MCP calls
- SKILL execution paths
- Agent workflow stages

The repository already includes supporting infrastructure and reference surfaces for:

- structured logs
- runtime traces
- artifact recording
- workflow state inspection
- analysis-oriented utilities such as `toolsinside`

This makes the project suitable not only for building LLM functions, but also for understanding, debugging, and improving them over time.

## Typical Usage

Typical usage scenarios include:

- embedding LLM chat into a Qt desktop application
- adding tool-calling and MCP-backed capability to an existing Qt product
- building internal operational tools around LLM workflows
- building domain-specific Agents with task pipelines, persisted state, and UI
